## Comment it! - MERN Stack app

---

`Comment it!` is a basic MERN (MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js) Stack application.

#### Concepts implemented:

- Set up a full stack application with the MERN architecture.
- Set up a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) API via Express
- Using that API to interact with an external database (mongoDB hosted in MLab)
- Used React for view part
